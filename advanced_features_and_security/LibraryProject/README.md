Library Management System
Project Overview
This project is a simple Library Management System built with Django. It demonstrates the use of a custom permissions system to control user access to different functionalities, such as viewing, creating, editing, and deleting books.

Key Features
Permissions-based access: Users are restricted to specific actions based on their assigned permissions.

User authentication: The system includes a basic authentication system to manage user logins.

CRUD operations: It supports the fundamental operations of Create, Read, Update, and Delete for book records.

Setup and Installation
Follow these steps to set up and run the project locally.

Clone the repository:

git clone [https://github.com/your-username/LibraryProject.git](https://github.com/your-username/LibraryProject.git)
cd LibraryProject

Create a virtual environment:

python -m venv venv

Activate the virtual environment:

On macOS/Linux:

source venv/bin/activate

On Windows:

venv\Scripts\activate

Install the required dependencies:

pip install Django

Run database migrations:

python manage.py makemigrations bookshelf
python manage.py migrate

Create a superuser:

python manage.py createsuperuser

Run the development server:

python manage.py runserver

The application will be accessible at http://127.0.0.1:8000.

Using the Permissions System
After running the migrations, the custom permissions (can_view, can_create, can_edit, can_delete) will be available in the Django admin panel. You can access the admin panel at http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/ to create user groups and assign these permissions.

Note: This is a foundational project designed to demonstrate permissions. Additional features like a user-facing front-end, more complex models, and improved styling are not included but can be built upon this structure.
